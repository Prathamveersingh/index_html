        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm <abbr title="Prathamveer Singh">Prathamveer</abbr>. I'm deeply passionate about computer science and its applications in solving real-world problems. Fascinated by the intricacies of software development, I've dedicated myself to honing my skills in programming languages and algorithms.</p>
        <p>Outside of coding, I find joy in exploring nature, capturing moments through photography, and delving into philosophical discussions. I believe in the power of continuous learning and self-improvement as key drivers of personal and professional growth.</p>
